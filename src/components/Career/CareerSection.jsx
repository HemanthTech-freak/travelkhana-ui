        <h2>Why work at Travelkhana?</h2>
        <p>
          Travelkhana.com is the first India-wide meal booking platform connecting train travelers with restaurants on the Indian Railways network. 
          More than 3 billion meals are consumed by long-distance train travelers every year. Yet, access to food inside train coaches is a major challenge. 
          Food vendors empaneled by the Indian Railways offer a limited choice of poor quality, unhygienic, and overpriced food. Pantry cars are known for abysmal food preparation quality and service.
        </p>
        <p>
          What is unique is that Travelkhana's platform tracks train running information to ensure meal delivery at the right time, at the right seat, fresh and ready to eat. 
          The entire process is managed by a completely automated workflow that sends real-time reminders to passengers as well as restaurants so that the entire process can happen smoothly and fast.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides trains, Travelkhana is also planning similar ventures in food for bus as well as air travelers. Travelkhana is a pioneer in its segment, and more information can be found on our media page.
